# in-class-help
This application is designed to help teaching assistants of coding classes.
When students are trying to follow along with the professor, they often
commit simple syntax errors or logic errors that prevent their code from
achieving the result as shown by the professor. This tool allows the student
to mark his/her current location so the the teaching assistant can come
over and help troubleshoot the problem.
